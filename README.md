## 🐾 Nico Pets 🐾

Nico Pets is a Python mini-project where users can adopt, name, and take care of digital pets. Each pet has attributes (like hunger, happiness, and energy) that change over time depending on player actions.
This project was built as a final requirement for a programming class to practice key concepts such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file pickling for saving/loading pet states.

## ✨ Features  
- 🐶 Adopt and name your own pet  
- 🍗 Feed, 🎮 play, or 😴 rest to keep your pet happy and healthy  
- ⏳ Stats update dynamically over time  
- 💾 Save and load pets using file pickling  


## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Language:** Python  
- **Concepts:** OOP, game logic, file pickling

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Support multiple pets at once
- Add more stats (health, cleanliness, friendship)
- Implement random events to make the game more challenging
- Create a GUI version with graphics
